title: Stupid Hackathon - CityFood
description: I participated in the "Stupid Hackathon" event with some friends, where the goal is to come up with a stupid product/idea. We came up with the idea for an app that would generate random recipes for you. We created a proof of concept app that we presented at the hackathon and we won the first price.
